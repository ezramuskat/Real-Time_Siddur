# Real-Time_Siddur
A repository for the real-time siddur app

This is an iOS app that uses Sefaria's database to provide davening specifically for the day, without having to look through unnecessary additions

**NOTE**: As of August 26, 2019, Sefaria's documented API requests do not work for their Liturgy section, and no documentation seems to exist for that section. As a result, until such documentation is found, this project will be halted
